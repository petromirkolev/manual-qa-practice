# Manual QA Practice

A structured repository for **manual QA work**: test design, execution, bug reporting, and API testing (Postman).

Each project has its own folder with clear artifacts.

---

## Repo structure

- **"projects/"** → QA artifacts for real apps
- **"exercises/"** → smaller drills and course-style practice

---

### Current projects

- **Odin Weather**

  - Manual UI test cases + executed test run summary
  - API test cases + Postman collection + executed run summary

- **Odin Todo**

  - Manual UI test cases (and bug reports)

---

## Exercises

Course/practice work that is not tied to a specific app:

- API testing drills (public APIs like DummyJSON / JSONPlaceholder)
- Test design exercises (equivalence partitions, boundary values, etc.)

---

## How to use

- Browse **"projects/"** for the most relevant portfolio work.
- Browse **"exercises/"** for supporting practice artifacts.
